This is a sorting algorithm meme idea that I saw on reddit and decided to make. 
Basically what this program does is it fills up an array with random numbers
Then it sorts the list by eliminating all numbers that are not sorted
I also did it graphically in 2 ways
StalinSort v1: Shows you the unsorted and sorted list
StaliSort V2: Shows you, number by number, which numbers get eliminated and which numbers are sorted
